This is the main github repository for Dragons Magic and Tech - Above Below and Beyond

All issue tracking (and eventually the wiki, when I have the time to make it) will be hosted on this page.

Need Help?

First off, many issues will stem from old versions of the pack or old versions of mods. To help with sorting through fixed or outdated reports please include the modpack version in your title.
Example title: [v0.0.3] Broken Crafting Recipe XYZ

Beyond that any mods that are added to the pack after installation should be included in the description of your report. I'm not saying this to condemn adding mods to the pack, by all means please experiment with different mods and suggest them to be added if they make enough of a difference to the gameplay and make the pack more enjoyable.
